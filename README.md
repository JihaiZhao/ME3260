# ME3260
This system included seven distinct subsystems: a reservoir and pipeline, a surge tank, penstock, pressure chamber, nozzle, turbine, and a power grid representing the final power output of the system. Each of these systems were able to be modeled based on skills gained in the course through the programs Simulink and MATLAB 2020.
